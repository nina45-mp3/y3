# Y3 Project: Bridging the gap between microbial metabolites and their enzymes (a code snapshot). 

This repository contains the code executing the main elements of my data pipeline (i.e., a BLAST run, host and source analysis of the BLAST results, sequence clustering, multiple sequence alignments, and phylogenetic tree computation). All code was written in bash, and submitted to a high-performance computing cluster to be run. Downloaded software (e.g., CD-HIT, Kalign) has been included, accounting for the other languages detected in this repository.

Other (data-wrangling) elements of my project were mostly performed directly in the Linux command line (using commands such as sed, awk and grep) and RStudio.
