# A snapshot of the code I have written for my Year 3, bile salt hydrolase data mining project.

This repository contains the code which executes the main elements of my data pipeline (i.e., a BLAST run, host and source analysis of the BLAST results, sequence clustering, multiple sequence alignments, and phylogenetic tree computation). 

Other (data-wrangling) elements of my project were mostly performed directly in the Linux command line, using commands like sed, awk and grep.
