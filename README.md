# A snapshot of the code I have written for my Year 3, bile salt hydrolase data mining project.

This repository contains the code executing the main elements of my data pipeline (i.e., a BLAST run, host and source analysis of the BLAST results, sequence clustering, multiple sequence alignments, and phylogenetic tree computation). All this code was written in bash, and submitted to a high-performance computing cluster to be run.

Other (data-wrangling) elements of my project were mostly performed directly in the Linux command line, using commands like sed, awk and grep.
